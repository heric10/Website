            8/21-8/24 Week 1 - This is my first journal entry. This week I learned about the basics in terms of functioning
        </br>
        <br>
            the AWS website and coding console. I learned all the different codes and what each letter means. We learned
        </br>
        <br>
            the respective codes for bold, italics, underline, different paragraphs, and a lot more. We officially cemented
        </br>
        <br>
            our website to Ms. Petrosian on a google spreadsheet and started to test and play around with the code like the title.
        </br>
        <br>
            We also learned about the safety hazards involved with engineering such as 
        </br>
        <br>
            using the proper glasses to protect your eyes, wearing proper clothing like closed shoes and aprons, and staying sanitzed.
        </br>
        <br>
            We also did a team building activity where we had to work together as a team to get a marble from point A to point B with  
        </br>
        <br>
            eight tracks and 16 people. It taught us about leadership, teamwork, revising plans, and most importantly, trial and error.

        <br>
            8/28-8/31 Week 2 - Second full week of school, I learned about how to use a program called tinkercad to practice modeling and scaling.
        </br>
        <br>
            I used my skills to the test for the challenge when I was challenged to make a home appliance and I make a red couch with four pillows on it.
        </br>
        <br>
            This week we also learned about mechanical engineering and tested our knowledge by taking a quiz on it. We learned about the safety of working in an engineering 
        </br>
        <br>
            environment. We watched a crash course video to understand more about steam engines and many types of engineering to better understand this subject and its branches.

        <br>
            9/5-9/8 Week 3 - This week we indulged more into tinkercad by plotting our project and getting the final finishing touches like making it 1:1 scale correct.
        </br>
        <br>
            After we finished our tinkercad, we reviewed for our test on mechanical engineering and fluid mechanics. After taking the test, it was time to actually begin on the project
        </br>
        <br>
            we have been plotting on tinkercad for the last week. Our group divided into different roles like the supplies person, the leader, the cutter, and the one that connects the pieces. We didn't do that much due to time
        </br>
        <br>
            but we got a good chunk done, we have to bring supplies from home like wheels and finish up on our ramp. A lot of work to do but I believe our group can get this done!

            9/11-9/14 Week 4 - This week we were on the final steps of our project. We spent the first two days preparing and finishing our contraption. We got permission from the teacher to use tape on our car to
        </br>
        <br>
            make our project more efficient and have a higher success rate when testing. We tested it once and it popped the balloon. Fast forward to the final day, we frantically got all of our supplies together
        </br>
        <br>
            to test our project one final time. We have a limited supply of balloons so we only had one shot and that one shot being our final grade. A bit of a stressful situation but we were confident in our precautions
        </br>
        <br>
            we took prior to the test. It ended up being a success. The needle on our car with a baseball on top popped the balloon after going down a ramp at enough velocity.

        <br>
            9/19-9/22 Week 5 - This week in engineering, we came across two challenges given by our teacher. One of which was to create a paper contraption, almost like a boat or a ship that can stay afloat. There was a twist,
        </br>
        <br>
            the twist was that it had to float for five minutes on water and be strong enough to hold weights. We got to choose how much weight we can put on our boats because we measured it in grams by a scale. Once you choose your
        </br>
        <br>
            weights you couldn't go lighter or heavier and the heaviest boat that stayed afloat wins. I got overcofident and put a 45g golf ball that made my boat sink. I got too over confiden but for the next challenge It was to design an "E" with measurements.
        <br>
            I designed my E well but the blueprint I recieved from another student didn't mathematically add up so I gave them a 7/10. We ended of the week by learning some more about computer engineering and taking notes on them for our quiz next week!

        <br>
            10/2-10/6 Week 7 - This week in engineering, I had to make up some work due to my absence the week prior. I took a quiz on computer engineering and computer parts like CPU, GPU, RAM, etc. I believed I did well
        </br>
        <br>
            on the quiz but I still haven't gotten my results. Continuing forward, my teacher presented me with a project to create a prosthetic hand out of cardboard, rubber bands, and strings. We did this project because we
        </br>
        <br>
            watched a video on Monday about prosthetic body parts like hearts actually functioning on human beings. I made a prototype but my teacher said it was a 8/10 at best and I was not satisfied so I did some changes and made it
        <br>
            look more modernizd and improved. After a few tweaks and changes I showed her again and I was able to complete the challenge of picking up a water bottle! I am very happy with the outcome and enjoyed the projet overall, can't wait to make more improvements. (ABSENT ON THU SO ONLY TALKED ABOUT MON & TUE)
