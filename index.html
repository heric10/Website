            8/21/23 - This is my first journal entry. This week I learned about the basics in terms of functioning
        </br>
        <br>
            the AWS website and coding console. I learned all the different codes and what each letter means. We learned
        </br>
        <br>
            the respective codes for bold, italics, underline, different paragraphs, and a lot more. We officially cemented
        </br>
        <br>
            our website to Ms. Petrosian on a google spreadsheet and started to test and play around with the code like the title.

            8/24/23 - This week in engineering class, I learned about the safety hazards involved with engineering.
        </br>
        <br>
            Using the proper glasses to protect your eyes, wearing proper clothing like closed shoes and aprons, and staying sanitzed.
        </br>
        <br>
            We also did a team building activity where we had to work together as a team to get a marble from point A to point B with  
        </br>
        <br>
            eight tracks and 16 people. It taught us about leadership, teamwork, revising plans, and most importantly, trial and error.

            8/28/23-8/31/23 - Second full week of school, I learned about how to use a program called tinkercad to practice modeling and scaling.
        </br>
        <br>
            I used my skills to the test for the challenge when I was challenged to make a home appliance and I make a red couch with four pillows on it.
        </br>
        <br>
            This week we also learned about mechanical engineering and tested our knowledge by taking a quiz on it. We learned about the safety of working in an engineering 
        </br>
        <br>
            environment. We watched a crash course video to understand more about steam engines and many types of engineering to better understand this subject and its branches.
